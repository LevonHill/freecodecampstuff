In these lecture videos, you will learn how to work with strings in JavaScript. You will learn how to access characters from a string, how to use template literals and interpolation, how to create a new line in strings, and much more.

Lesson 1
What is bracket notation and how do you access characters from a string?

In JavaScript, strings are treated as sequences of characters, and each character in a string can be accessed using bracket notation. This allows you to retrieve a specific character from a string based on its position, which is called its index.

An index is the position of a character within a string, and it is zero-based. This means that the first character of a string has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on.

For example, in the string hello, the character h is at index 0, e is at index 1, l is at index 2, and so on.

Bracket notation uses square brackets ([]) and the index of the character you want to access. Let’s look at an example:

let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting[1]); // Output: "e"
In this example, we can access the character at index 1, which is e.

To get the last character of a string, you can use the length of the string minus one. The length property of a string tells you how many characters it contains, so to access the last character, you would subtract one from the length:

let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting[greeting.length - 1]); // Output: "o"
In this case, the length of hello is 5, and the last character (o) is at index 4 which is 5 - 1.

If you want to get multiple characters, you can use bracket notation like this:

let greeting = "hello";
let firstTwo = greeting[0] + greeting[1]; // Output: "he"
console.log(firstTwo);
In this example, we are concatenating the first and second characters using bracket notation to form the string he.

Bracket notation is useful when you need to access specific characters in a string, such as extracting initials from a name or checking a specific letter for validation.

Lesson 2
How do you create a newline in strings and escape strings in JavaScript?

When working with strings in JavaScript, there are times when you need to include special characters that the JavaScript engine might otherwise misinterpret.

Two common tasks involve creating a newline within a string and escaping certain characters (like quotes) to make sure they appear correctly.

In many programming languages, including JavaScript, you can create a newline in a string using a special character called an escape sequence. The most common escape sequence for newlines is \n.

For example, if you want to break a string into multiple lines, you would use \n where you want the new line to begin:

let poem = "Roses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nJavaScript is fun,\nAnd so are you.";
console.log(poem);
The output will be:

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is fun,
And so are you.
The \n escape sequence tells JavaScript to insert a line break at that point, which results in the string being displayed across multiple lines.

Another important concept when working with strings is escaping characters. Sometimes, you need to include characters in your string that JavaScript normally uses for something else, such as quotes.

If you simply use quotes inside a string without escaping them, it can cause an error because JavaScript will think you're trying to end the string.

For example, this will cause an error:

let statement = "She said, "Hello!"";
JavaScript gets confused because it thinks the string ends after the word "said," but, you want the quotes around "Hello!" to be part of the string.

To fix this, you can escape the inner quotes by placing a backslash (\) before them:

let statement = "She said, \"Hello!\"";
console.log(statement); // Output: She said, "Hello!"
The backslash tells JavaScript to treat the quotes as literal characters, so they appear correctly in the output.

You can also escape other special characters, such as the backslash itself (\\), or single quotes within a string surrounded by single quotes (\').

Here's another example using single quotes:

let quote = 'It\'s a beautiful day!';
console.log(quote); // Output: It's a beautiful day!
By escaping the single quote with \', JavaScript knows to include it as part of the string rather than ending the string early.

Escaping and creating newlines are essential when you’re formatting output or handling special characters in strings. These techniques help you prevent errors and ensure your text appears exactly as intended.

Lesson 3
What are template literals, and what is string interpolation?

In JavaScript, template literals are a powerful and flexible way to work with strings. Unlike regular strings, which use single (') or double (") quotes, template literals are defined with backticks (`).

They allow for easier string manipulation, including embedding variables directly inside a string, a feature known as string interpolation.

Template literals make it easier to create strings that span multiple lines or include expressions (like variables or even JavaScript code) directly within the string.

Here's a basic example of a template literal:

let name = "Alice";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
Notice the use of backticks instead of single or double quotes. The ${name} syntax is an example of string interpolation, where the value of the variable name is directly inserted into the string.

String interpolation allows you to embed variables and expressions inside a string. This is a significant improvement over the older method, where you would concatenate strings and variables using the + operator.

Here is an example using string concatenation and the plus (+) operator:

let name = "Alice";
let age = 25;
let message = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
console.log(message); // Output: "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
And here is an example using template literals and string interpolation:

let message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message); // Output: "My name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
As you can see, string interpolation with template literals is much cleaner and easier to read, especially when you're working with multiple variables.

Another great feature of template literals is that they support multiline strings. With regular strings, you would need to use escape characters (\n) to create new lines. With template literals, you can simply write the string across multiple lines, and the formatting is preserved:

let poem = `Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is fun,
And so are you.`;

console.log(poem);
The output will retain the line breaks as written:

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is fun,
And so are you.
Template literals are particularly useful when you need to include variables or expressions in strings, format complex strings, or work with multiline text. They are more concise and readable compared to traditional string concatenation.
