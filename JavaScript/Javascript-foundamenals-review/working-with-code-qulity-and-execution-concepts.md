In these lectures you will learn what are linters and formatters, what is memory management, and closures.

Lesson 1
What Are Linters and Formatters, and How Can They Help You with Code Consistency?
In the world of software development maintaining clean, consistent and error-free code is important. This is where linters and formatters come into play. These tools are essential for developers to ensure code quality and consistency across projects and teams.

Let's start with linters. A linter is a static code analysis tool that flags programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term lint comes from a Unix utility that examines C language source code.

Today linters exist for most programming languages including JavaScript. Linters help in several ways. First they catch potential errors before runtime. For example, a linter might flag the use of undefined variable or a function being called with the wrong number of arguments. They also enforce coding standards and best practices. This might include rules about indentation, the use of semicolons, or the maximum allowed line length. Lastly, they help maintain consistency across a codebase especially when multiple developers are working on the same project.

A popular linter for JavaScript is ESLint. Here is a simple example of what ESLint might flag:

function doSomething(x) {
return x + z
}
In this code variable z is not declared, so ESLint would flag the error z is not defined. Also, the last statement is missing a semicolon which ESLint might also flag in the code editor.

Formatters on the other hand are tools that automatically format your code to adhere to a specific style guide. While linters can often autofix some issues, formatters are specifically designed to rewrite your code to match a predetermined style.

Formatters ensure a consistent code style across an entire project or team regardless of individual developer preferences. They also save time and mental energy that would otherwise be spent on manual formatting. Lastly, they can make code reviews more efficient by eliminating discussions about code style.

A popular formatter for JavaScript is Prettier. Here is an example of how Prettier might format code. Here's a before formatting:

function longFunction(
argument1,
argument2,
argument3
) {return argument1 + argument2 + argument3;}
And then after the prettier formatting:

function longFunction(argument1, argument2, argument3) {
return argument1 + argument2 + argument3;
}
Both linters and formatters can be integrated into your development workflow in various ways. They can be included in your build process or added as plugins to your text editor or IDE providing real-time feedback as you code. Using linters and formatters together can significantly improve code quality and consistency. For example, you might use ESLint to catch potential errors and enforce certain coding practices, and then use Prettier to handle all formatting tasks.

Many development teams set up these tools as part of their project configuration often with pre-commit hooks that run the linter and formatter before allowing code to be committed. This ensures that all code in the repository meets the teams standards for quality and style.

In summary, linters and formatters are powerful tools that help maintain code quality, catch potential errors early, and ensure consistency across codebases. By automating these aspects of code review they allow developers to focus more on solving problems and less on debating code style.

Lesson 2

What Is Memory Management, and How Does It Work in JavaScript?
Memory management is an essential concept in programming, but it can be a bit confusing for beginners, let's break it down in simple terms.

When you run a program, including JavaScript code in a web browser, it needs memory to store all the information its working with. This includes variables, functions, objects, basically everything your code creates and uses. Memory management is the process of controlling this memory, allocating it when needed, and freeing it up when it's no longer needed. In some programming languages, developers have to manually manage memory. They need to explicitly tell the computer when to allocate memory for new things and when to free up memory that's no longer needed. This can be powerful but also tricky as forgetting to free memory can lead to memory leaks.

JavaScript however uses automatic memory management. This means that JavaScript (more specifically the JavaScript engine in your web browser) takes care of memory allocation and deallocation for you. You don't have to explicitly free memory in your code. This automatic process is often called garbage collection.

Here's how it works in simple terms. First allocation happens when you create a variable, objects or functions in your JavaScript code, memory is automatically allocated to store them. Then you use this allocated memory when you work with these variables, objects or functions in your code.

The JavaScript engine has clever ways to figure out when something in memory is no longer needed. Generally if there is no way for your program to access or use a piece of data any more it's considered no longer needed. Periodically the garbage collector runs, it finds a memory that's no longer needed and frees it up, making it available for future use. This process happens automatically which is great because it means you don't have to worry about managing memory yourself.

However, it's still important to understand this concept because you can sometimes accidentally keep references to things you don't need anymore preventing the garbage collector from freeing that memory. For example:

function createLargeArray() {
let largeArray = new Array(1000000);
return function() {
console.log(largeArray.length);
};
}

let printArrayLength = createLargeArray();
printArrayLength();
In this code, even after createLargeArray finishes running, largeArray can't be garbage collected because the returned function still has access to it. This is a closure, and while closures are useful they can sometimes lead to more memory usage than you might expect. You will learn more about closures in future lectures.

As a beginner, you don't need to worry too much about the intricacies of memory management. JavaScript's automatic garbage collection takes care of most things for you. However, as you advance in your JavaScript journey, understanding these concepts can help you write more efficient code, especially for larger applications or when working with limited resources.

Remember, good coding practices, like avoiding global variables when possible and being mindful of what your functions are closing over, can help the JavaScript engine manage memory more efficiently.

Lesson 3

What Are Closures, and How Do They Work?

Closures are one of the most powerful and often misunderstood features in JavaScript. At its core, a closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer enclosing lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned. This might sound complex but it's a fundamental concept that enables many advanced programming patterns in JavaScript.

To understand closures, let's start with an example:

function outerFunction(x) {
let y = 10;
function innerFunction(){
console.log(x + y);
}
return innerFunction;
}

let closure = outerFunction(5);
closure(); // Output: 15
In this example, outerFunction takes a parameter x and defines a local variable y. It then defines an innerFunction that uses both x and y. Finally it returns innerFunction. When we call outerFunction(5) it returns innerFunction which we assign to the variable closure. When we later call closure() it still has access to x and y from outerFunction even though outerFunction has already finished executing. This is the essence of a closure.

The inner function maintains a reference to its outer lexical environment, preserving access to the variables in that environment even after the outer function has completed.

Closures are particularly useful for creating private variables and functions. Consider this example:

function createCounter() {
let count = 0;
return function () {
count++;
return count;
};
}

let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2
In this case, createCounter returns a function that increments and returns a count variable. The count variable is not directly accessible from outside createCounter, but the returned function (our closure) has access to it. Each time we call counter(), it increments and returns the count.

Closures can also capture multiple variables from their outer scope. For example:

function multiply(x) {
return function (y) {
return x \* y;
};
}

let double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
Here the inner function captures the x parameter from multiply. When we create double by calling multiply(2) it returns a function that always multiplies its argument by 2.

One important thing to note about closures is that they capture variables, by reference not by value. This means if the value of a captured variable changes, the closure will see the new value. For example:

function createIncrementer() {
let count = 0;
return function () {
count++;
console.log(count);
};
}

let increment = createIncrementer();
increment(); // Output: 1
increment(); // Output: 2
Each time we call increment its working with the same count variable, not a copy of it's initial value. Closures are a powerful tool in JavaScript. as you continue to work with JavaScript you'll find that understanding and using closures effectively can greatly enhance your ability to write clean, efficient and powerful code.
