what is html (Hyper text Markup Language) ,and what role does it play on the web?
Its a markup language used for creating webpages , when you visit a website and see content, like paragraphs, headings ,links ,images ,and videos, thats html, it represents the content and structure of a webpage through the use of elements quick example of a paragraph element ,' <p> bullshit text </p> it takes an open and closed tag , closed tags are represented by '</p>' and the content resides inside the tags, now the content can be text or other HTML elements...
Some HTML elements dont have a closing tag, these are known as 'void' elements, an example of one would be '<img>' used for images and it doesnt have a any content , void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag , if you wanna display an image you'll need to include a few attributes to it inside your image element, an attribute is a special value used to adjust the behavior for an html element. Heres an example of an image element with 'src' or source attribute , "<img src= 'image location'/>" , img -is the tag name, src-is the attribute name , image location -is the attribute value
the source attribute is used to specify the location for that image , for image elements its good practice to use , 'Alt',attribute example '<img src= 'picture' alt ='photo of developer'>' , now we have an image with the src and alt attribute, alt attribute is used to provide short descriptive text for the image.

//what are Html Attributes, An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. example of the syntax: '<div id = "root" ></div>' div= element , id= attribute , root = value
,another example '<a href = "https://www.example-website.com">Visit our website</a>' a = tag ,href = attribute, "https://www.example-website.com"=value

The first example is the href attribute which is used to specify the URL of a link, without this attribute link would not work because there would be no distination URL so you must include this href attribute, to make the link functional, other common attributes include the , source 'src', and the 'atl', alternative attribute which used to specifiy the source of an image and provide the alternative text for the image respectively similar to the href attribute the SRC attribute is required because it specifiies the image file to be displayed, the alt is recommended for accessibility , accsessibility means making sure that everyone even those with disabilities understand things like websites ,apps, and physical spaces. will learn more about this in upcoming lectures

//what is the link element
The Link Element -the link element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. Here is the basic syntax for using the link element for an external CSS , '<link rel="stylesheet" href = "./styles.css"/>', rel attribute is used to specifiy the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document in this situation we need to specify that this resource is a stylesheet, its considered best practices to seperate your HTML and CSS in different files developers, will use the link element for their CSS file instead of writing everything in the HTML document, the href attribue is used to specify the location of the URL for the external resource the dot followed by a forward slash in the href value tells the cpu to look to the current folder or directory for the styles.css files.... , the link element should be placed inside the head element in "index.html", often times you will see mulitple link elements inside a professional code base that link to different stylesheets with fonts and even icons ''preconnect'' ,

google fonts are a set of free and open-source custom fonts that you can use inside any project, this tell the browser to create an early connection to the value specified in the href attibute, this is done to speed up loading times for these external resources. Another common use case for the link element is to link icons using favicon as example.
