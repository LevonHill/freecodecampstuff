    <!--The action attribute is used to specify where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted.

The method attribute is used to specify the HTTP method to use when sending the form data. The most common methods are GET and POST.

NOTE: You will learn about how HTTP methods work in later modules.
left on step 7
Inside your main element, add a form element with an action attribute set to "https://hotel-feedback.freecodecamp.org" and a method attribute set to "POST".-->
    <main>
      <!--Forms consist of inputs where users can input their data. You can group related inputs together using the fieldset element.

Here is an example of using a fieldset element:

Example Code
<form action="/example-url">
  <fieldset>
 inputs go inside here
  </fieldset>
</form> -->

      <!--When working with fieldset elements, it is common to use a caption to describe the group of inputs. You can use the legend element for this.
Here is an example of using a legend element:-->
      <form method="POST" action="https://hotel-feedback.freecodecamp.org">
        <!--The for attribute on the label element should match the id attribute on the input element. This is known as an explicit association.-->
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Personal Information</legend>
          <label for="Full-name">Name:</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            id="full-name"
            name="name"
            placeholder="Ex. John Doe"
            required
            size="25"
          />
          <label for="email">Email address (required):</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="email"
            name="email"
            required
            placeholder="example@email.com"
            size="25"
          />
          <label for="age">Age (optional):</label>
          <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="18" max="100" />
          <!--The name attribute is used to identify form data after it has been submitted to the server.Here is an example of how to use the name attribute:
In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to work with the placeholder and required attributes 
input elements can have a size attribute. This attribute defines the number of characters that should be visible as the user types into the input. The value of size should be a non-negative integer greater than zero. If size is not specified, or is specified with an invalid value, the input will have the default width set by the browser.-->
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Was this your first time at our hotel</legend>
          <label for="yes-option">Yes</label>
          <input type="radio" id="yes-option" name="hotel-stay" />
          <label for="no-option">No</label>
          <input type="radio" id="no-option" name="hotel-stay" />
        </fieldset>
        <!--Step 18The next section in the form will be responsible for asking users if they have stayed at the hotel before.Start by adding a fieldset element.
Inside the fieldset element, add a legend element with the text of Was this your first time at our hotel?.
If you want users to select one option from a list of options, you can use a set of radio buttons.   
In this example, the radio buttons are grouped together by using the same name attribute value. This means that only one radio button can be selected at a time.
Below your legend element, add a label element with the text Yes and a for attribute set to "yes-option". 

now Step 21
The next section of the form will ask users why they chose that particular hotel. Users will have the opportunity to select multiple options.
start by adding another fieldset element.
Inside the fieldset element, add a legend element with the text Why did you choose to stay at our hotel? (Check all that apply).

When you want a user to select multiple options from a list, you can use checkboxes.
Here is an example of how to work with checkboxes 
The value attribute is used to specify the value that will be sent to the server when the form is submitted.
-->
        <fieldset>
          <legend>
            Why did you choose to stay at our hotel? (Check all that apply)
          </legend>
          <label for="ads">Social Media Ads</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="ads" value="ads" name="ads" />
          <label for="recommendation">Personal Recommendation</label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            name="recommendation"
            id="recommendation"
            value="recommendation"
          />
          <label for="location">Location</label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            name="location"
            id="location"
            value="location"
          />
          <label for="reputation">reputation</label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            name="reputation"
            id="reputation"
            value="reputation"
            checked
          />
          <label for="price">price</label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="price" value="price" id="price" />
          <!--To make a checkbox input checked by default, you can add the checked attribute.
Here is an example of using the checked attribute:-->
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Ratings</legend>
          <label for="service">How was the service?</label>
          <select name="service" id="service">
            <option value="poor">Poor</option>
            <option value="satisfactory">Satisfactory</option>
            <option value="good">Good</option>
            <option value="very-good">Very Good</option>
            <option value="excellent" selected>Excellent</option>
          </select>

          <label for="food">How was the food?</label>
          <select name="food" id="food">
            <option value="poor">Poor</option>
            <option value="satisfactory">Satisfactory</option>
            <option value="good">Good</option>
            <option value="very good">Very Good</option>
            <option value="excellent" selected>Excellent</option>
          </select>
          <label for="comments">Other Comments?</label>
          <textarea
            name="comments"
            id="comments"
            cols="30"
            rows="10"
          ></textarea>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </fieldset>
        <!--The next section of the form will provide users with the ability to leave a rating for the hotel.
Start by adding a new fieldset element with a legend element nested inside. The legend should have the text Ratings.
!!!!  When you want users to make selections from a dropdown menu, you can use the select and option elements.

Inside your select element, add the following five option elements with these corresponding values for the option text and value attribute:
To make an option selected by default, you can add the selected attribute to the option element you want to be selected.

Step 33
The last section of the form will allow users to provide any additional feedback they like about the hotel.
Start by adding a label element with the text of Other Comments? and a for attribute set to "comments".
If you want users to have more space to write their comments, you can use a textarea element.
The textarea element is a multi-line text input control that allows users to enter text that is longer than a single line. It can be used to create a comment box, a message input, or other text input that requires multiple lines.
he rows attribute is used to specify the visible height of the textarea, and the cols attribute is used to specify the visible width of the textarea.
