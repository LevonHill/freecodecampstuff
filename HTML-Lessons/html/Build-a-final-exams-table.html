<!--Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice working with HTML tables by building a final exam table for a group of students.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Calculus Final Exams Table</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--Step 4
To add a caption to a table, you can use the table caption element. Here is an example using the caption element:

Step 5
For the first section of the table, you will want to group the header content which represents the column labels for the student's first name, last name, and final exam grade.
The table head element, thead, is used to group the header content in a table.

Step 6
The table head element consists of a table row element, tr, which contains the table header cell elements, th.
Here is an example using the tr and th elements for a sports table:

Step 7
Now that you have completed the head section, it is time to add the table body, tbody. The table body will represent all of the student names and their grades.

Step 8
To add student data to the table, you will need to use the table row and table data elements.The table data element, td, is used to create a cell in the table.

Here is an example of using the td element for a sports players table:

Step 9
Now it is time to add two more students to the table.

Following the same pattern as the previous step, add a second student table row. Use the following data for the table data elements:-->

    <table>
        <caption>Calculus Final Exam Grades</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Last Name</th>
              <th>First Name</th>
              <th>Grade</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Davis</td>
                <td>Alex</td>
                <td>54</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Doe</td>
                <td>Samantha</td>
                <td>92</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rodriguez</td>
                <td>Marcus</td>
                <td>88</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Thompson</td>
                <td>Jane</td>
                <td>77</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Williams</td>
                <td>Natalie</td>
                <td>83</td>
            </tr>
            <!--Step 11
The last section to add to the table would be the table foot element, tfoot. The table foot element will be used to display the average grade for all of the students in the table.

Your table is almost complete but there is one last thing to add.
It would be nice if the td element used for the Average Grade would span across two columns instead of just one.
To do this, you can use the colspan attribute on the td element.
The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.-->
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Average Grade</td>
                  <td>78.8</td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</body>
