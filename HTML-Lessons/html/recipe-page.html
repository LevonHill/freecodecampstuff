      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2-3 medium sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>optinal: 1/2 teaspoon paprika or cinnamon (for extra flavor)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Wash, peel, and chop sweet
          potatoes into even-sized cubes (about 1 inch).
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss the cubes in olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and any
          optional spices. Coat them evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange the cubes on a baking sheet — single layer, no overlapping.
          Give them space to crisp, not steam.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 25–30 minutes, flipping halfway. You want golden edges and
          fork-tender centers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven. Let them rest 2–3 minutes. Then eat — alone, or
          as a side to your next conquest.
        </li>
      </ol>
