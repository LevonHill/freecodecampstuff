    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <!--The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in
  the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL
  parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request
  body (with method="post"). Set the method attribute to send your form data via
  a POST request. NOTE: You will learn more about the GET and POST methods in
  the upcoming lecture videos and workshops.
  
  As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.

  Nest an input element within each label. 
  Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon.


  Specifying the type attribute of an input element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it
   should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.


   At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.

To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.


Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. 
For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

Add custom validation to the password input element,
 by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.

 With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the 
 password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more 
lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.

          <input type="text" id="last-name" required />

          <input

      <!--Currently users can submit the form without checking the radio inputs. 
      Although you previously used the required attribute to indicate that an input is required,
       it won't work in this case because adding required to both inputs will convey the wrong information to users.

To solve this, you can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text 
Account type (required) before the label elements within the second fieldset. 
Then add the checked attribute to the Personal input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it.

oving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

Well, the input type file allows just that. 
Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , 
and nest an input accepting a file upload.


Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. 
The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
