/*Now you have something that is resembling a building. You are ready to create your first variable.
 In the previous lecture videos you learned that variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) 
 and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;. In the rule for the bb1 class, create a variable named 
 --building-color1 and give it a value of #999.*/
