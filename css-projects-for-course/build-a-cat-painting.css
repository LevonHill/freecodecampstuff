/*project notes , Use the universal selector to add box-sizing:
 border-box; to your CSS. This ensures elements include 
 padding and border in their specified width and height.
 
 CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned in the browser. 
 It has a position property you can set to static, absolute, relative, sticky or fixed.
 
 When you use the relative value, 
 the element is still positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
 but the top, left, bottom, and right values become active.
 

 When you use the absolute value for your position property, the element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, 
 and then its position is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
 
 fixed is a position property value that lets you make an element fixed to the
  page no matter where the user scrolls to on the page.*/
