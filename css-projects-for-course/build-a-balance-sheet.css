/*Time to style your table. Start by resetting the box model. 
Create an html selector and give it a box-sizing property set to border-box.

Before you get too far into your styling, 
you should make use of the sr-only class. 
You can use CSS to make elements with this class completely hidden from the visual page,
 but still be announced by screen readers.
 The CSS you are about to write is a common set of properties used to ensure elements 
 are completely hidden visually.

 he CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. Set the span[class~="sr-only"]
  selector to have a clip property of rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px).

The clip-path property determines the shape the clip property should take.
 Set the clip-path property to the value of inset(50%),
 forming the clip-path into a rectangle within the element.
