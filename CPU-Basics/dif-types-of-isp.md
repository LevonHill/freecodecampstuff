What are the different types of internet service providers?

First, what is an internet service provider, or ISP? Itâ€™s a company that sells access to the global internet network, essentially. And they come in three different tiers.

The first tier are the giant conglomerate companies, which have the infrastructure to handle most (if not all) of their network traffic independently.

The second tier are the country-wide providers, which sometimes rent access to tier 1 networks but can stand fairly well on their own.

The third tier are the small companies that primarily focus on providing internet to local markets, and rely on larger ISPs to provide their infrastructure.

These providers will offer different types of connections as well.

Fibre optic connections rely on glass or plastic fibres to transmit data via light, resulting in very high connection speeds and data exchange.

Cable connections use the same infrastructure as a cable television provider, which often makes them readily available in many regions.

DSL connections use the infrastructure that landline phone services use. Because of the prevalence of this infrastructure, DSL is available in areas where cable might not be. But it is also frequently a slower option.

Dial-up also uses the phone lines, but requires exclusive connection (disabling the use of the line for phone purposes when connected to the internet). This is a much older technology that has fallen into disuse.

Satellite connections use an array of satellites orbiting the earth to connect various devices across the world. And finally, similar to that, a 5G home internet provider uses the cell tower infrastructure to keep you online.

And that should give you a basic rundown of what types of internet service providers and internet connections are out there!
