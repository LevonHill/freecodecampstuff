“I built a secure, internal tool that lets us trigger workflows automatically from inside ServiceNow — even when users aren’t on VPN — while keeping everything protected behind authentication.”

Now you're not just a dev.
You're a problem-solver.

🧱 Demo Structure to Win the Room
🎯 What’s the problem?

“Right now, we can't securely trigger actions from a locked-out machine without VPN access.”

⚙️ What did you build?

“A secure Node.js endpoint tied to ServiceNow that can trigger workflows externally.”

🔐 How is it secured?

“Only specific roles can call the endpoint. It's behind company auth and uses ACLs and token auth.”

🚀 What’s the impact?

“This lets us reset passwords or unlock accounts from a self-service page — even when users are off-network.”

💡 What could be next?

“We could extend this to onboarding, device registration, or field tech automation.”
