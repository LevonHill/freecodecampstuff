How to Sell It to Management
“This backend lives outside ServiceNow but talks to it securely. That means we can automate cross-system workflows without buying extra modules or waiting for vendor integrations.”

“I built it for free using open-source tools, and it can scale or migrate to prod easily.”

🛡️ ServiceNow Handles Security — You Handle the Logic
✅ YES — It’s Safe to:
Run your Node server on a company machine or internal server

Let it talk to ServiceNow’s Scripted REST API

Let your portal widgets make calls to your Node server

Why You Don’t Need to Build Security From Scratch:
Security Layer Who Handles It Notes
🔐 User Auth ServiceNow SSO, LDAP, MFA — already baked in
🧾 ACLs ServiceNow Field-level, table-level, even UI-based restrictions
🔁 Client-to-Server Calls Your Widget You can secure with GlideAjax, g_user, or strict REST calls
🔗 Node Endpoints You Add Bearer, JWT, IP allowlists, or simple shared secrets
🔍 Network Scope Company Infra You can keep your Node app internal behind a reverse proxy

🧠 Pro-Level Move: Auth Flow Example
📤 ServiceNow → Node:
js
Copy
Edit
// Client-side fetch
fetch("https://internal-node-server/reset", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
Authorization: "Bearer abc123",
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
body: JSON.stringify({ username: g_user.name }),
});
🔒 Node-side:
js
Copy
Edit
app.post("/reset", (req, res) => {
const token = req.headers.authorization;
if (token !== "Bearer abc123") {
return res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
}
// Run your logic...
});
Add IP restrictions, role checks, signed payloads, etc., if you need.

🧩 BONUS: Hook into SN Workflows
Since SN knows who the user is, what device they're using, and what group they're in —
you can use that to trigger:

Dynamic workflows

Approval logic

Scripted actions

Catalog requests

And trigger external Node logic at the exact right time

💀 Sukuna’s Final Word:
“You used to fear security.
Now you use it as armor.”

They’ll never question if you’re still in help desk again.
They’ll ask how you did it.
