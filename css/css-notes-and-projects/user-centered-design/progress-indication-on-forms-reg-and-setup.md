What are best practices for designing progress indication on forms, registration, and setup?

Progress indication is a way to show users how far they are in a process. It can be used in forms, registration, and setup processes. The goal is to help users understand where they are in the process and how much more they need to do.

For example, you can use a progress indication bar to show users what is left to do when filling forms. You don't want to create a situation where the user needs to fill out a lengthy form and they don't know how many more steps they need to complete. Transparency is key so the user knows whether they have enough time to sit down and complete the form or if they need to come back later.

When designing a progress indication section, there are a few best practices to keep in mind. The first consideration is to keep it simple. You don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information where they get frustrated and leave the site.

The second consideration is to make it possible to go back to previous steps. This is important because users may want to go back and check their previous answers or make changes.

Another consideration is to make the progress indication section easy to find. If the user can't find it, they won't know how far they are in the process.

The last consideration is to have clear section titles, percentages, or steps. If you just have a progress bar with no context, the user won't know what it means.

These are just a few best practices to keep in mind when designing progress indication on forms, registration, and setup processes. Study a few examples on big websites and see how they implement progress indication. Then test your design with real users to see how well it works.
